There are several tools available for monitoring, profiling, and troubleshooting Java Virtual Machine (JVM) applications. Here are some commonly used tools for JVM:

1. **jps** (Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool): Lists the Java processes running on a machine along with their Process IDs (PIDs) and main class names.

2. **jstat** (Java Virtual Machine Statistics Monitoring Tool): Provides JVM statistics such as memory usage, garbage collection statistics, class loader information, and more.

3. **jmap** (Java Memory Map): Allows you to obtain heap memory usage, generate heap dumps, and perform memory-related operations.

4. **jstack** (Java Stack Trace): Prints the stack traces of Java threads, helping in thread analysis and deadlock detection.

5. **jconsole** (Java Monitoring and Management Console): A graphical tool for monitoring and managing Java applications. It provides a real-time view of JVM and application performance, thread analysis, memory usage, and more.

6. **jvisualvm** (Java VisualVM): A powerful visual tool that combines features of several other tools, including jstat, jmap, jstack, and jconsole. It provides extensive profiling and monitoring capabilities, as well as advanced profiling plugins.

7. **jcmd** (Java Command): A command-line utility that allows you to manage and monitor Java applications, including features like VM information, thread analysis, garbage collection operations, and more.

8. **Java Flight Recorder (JFR)**: A profiling and event recording framework built into the JVM. It provides low-overhead continuous monitoring and recording of JVM events, such as method execution, garbage collection, thread activity, and more.

9. **Java Mission Control (JMC)**: A comprehensive monitoring and management tool that works in conjunction with Java Flight Recorder. It offers advanced profiling, diagnostics, and analysis features for JVM applications.

10. **VisualVM**: A visual tool that provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and profiling JVM applications. It offers real-time performance monitoring, memory and CPU profiling, and thread analysis.

These tools are part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and can be accessed from the command line or through their respective graphical user interfaces. They provide valuable insights into JVM performance, memory usage, thread behavior, and overall application health.
