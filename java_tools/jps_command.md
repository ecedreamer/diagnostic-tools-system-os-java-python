The `jps` command is a utility provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) that allows you to list the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) processes running on a machine. It provides information about the Java processes, such as their Process IDs (PIDs) and the main class names of the applications. Here's some information about the `jps` command and its usage:

1. Command Syntax:
   ```
   jps [options]
   ```

   - `[options]`: Optional command-line options to customize the behavior of `jps`.

2. Commonly Used Options:
   - `-l`: Prints the main class name of the Java process along with its PID.
   - `-m`: Prints the main class name and the arguments passed to the Java process along with its PID.
   - `-v`: Prints the main class name, arguments, and JVM arguments passed to the Java process along with its PID.

3. Examples:
   - To list the Java processes with their PIDs:
     ```
     jps
     ```

   - To list the Java processes with their PIDs and main class names:
     ```
     jps -l
     ```

   - To list the Java processes with their PIDs, main class names, and arguments:
     ```
     jps -m
     ```

   - To list the Java processes with their PIDs, main class names, arguments, and JVM arguments:
     ```
     jps -v
     ```

4. Additional Resources:
   - The official Oracle documentation provides more information about `jps` and its options: [JDK Tools and Utilities](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/jdk-tools.html)
   - The OpenJDK project also provides information about `jps`: [OpenJDK - jps](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/112)

Please note that `jps` is typically included in the JDK installation and can be found in the `bin` directory. It is a handy tool for identifying the Java processes running on a machine, especially when you need to work with other Java diagnostic and monitoring tools.
