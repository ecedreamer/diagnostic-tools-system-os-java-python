The `jstat` command is a utility provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) that allows you to monitor various statistics related to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), such as memory usage, garbage collection, class loading, and more. It provides a command-line interface for real-time monitoring and analysis of JVM performance. Here's some information about `jstat` and its usage:

1. Command Syntax:
   ```
   jstat [options] <vmid> [interval [count]]
   ```

   - `<vmid>`: The virtual machine identifier, which can be the process ID (PID) or the numeric VM identifier.
   - `[interval]`: The time interval between each sample in milliseconds (default is 1000 ms).
   - `[count]`: The number of samples to collect (default is infinite).

2. Commonly Used Options:
   - `-class`: Prints class loader statistics.
   - `-compiler`: Prints Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler statistics.
   - `-gc`: Prints garbage collection statistics.
   - `-gcutil`: Prints garbage collection utilization statistics.
   - `-gccapacity`: Prints garbage collection heap capacity statistics.
   - `-gcnew`: Prints new generation garbage collection statistics.
   - `-gcold`: Prints old generation garbage collection statistics.
   - `-gcmetacapacity`: Prints metaspace capacity and utilization statistics (Java 8+).
   - `-gcutil`: Prints garbage collection utilization statistics.
   - `-printcompilation`: Prints JIT compilation method details.

3. Examples:
   - To monitor the memory usage of a JVM process:
     ```
     jstat -gc <vmid> <interval> <count>
     ```

   - To monitor the utilization of the garbage collector:
     ```
     jstat -gcutil <vmid> <interval> <count>
     ```

   - To monitor the new generation garbage collection:
     ```
     jstat -gcnew <vmid> <interval> <count>
     ```

   - To monitor the old generation garbage collection:
     ```
     jstat -gcold <vmid> <interval> <count>
     ```

   - To print JIT compilation details:
     ```
     jstat -printcompilation <vmid> <interval> <count>
     ```

4. Finding the Virtual Machine Identifier (vmid):
   To use `jstat`, you need to provide the vmid, which can be the process ID (PID) or the numeric VM identifier. You can find the vmid using tools like `jps` (Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool) or operating system-specific utilities like `ps` (Linux/Mac) or `tasklist` (Windows).

5. Additional Resources:
   - The official Oracle documentation provides a complete list of `jstat` options and their usage: [JDK Tools and Utilities](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/jdk-tools.html)
   - The OpenJDK project also provides extensive documentation on `jstat`: [OpenJDK - jstat](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/203)

Please note that the available options and their behavior may vary depending on the JDK version and the specific JVM implementation you are using.
